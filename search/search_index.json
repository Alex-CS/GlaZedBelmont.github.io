This guide will guide you through dumping your cart to ap patch the rom. What you will need: A hacked 3DS with Luma with GodMode9 ( GodMode9.firm in luma/payloads ) DS or DSi enhanced game cartridges. Click here to help identify which type the cart is. DS-Scene Rom Tool (Optional) xDelta Patcher Click here to see if your game requires AP patching or not Note that you can skip Section I if you've already dumped your cart to an untrimmed format Section I: Dumping Boot your 3DS console while holding the Start button to boot into GodMode9. If GodMode9 1.8.0 hangs to a splash screen, has blank screen(s), or its just not booting at all, make a copy of the GodMode9.firm and rename this copy to whatever you'd like, so after that, you will have two .firm files in luma/payloads . Navigate over [C:] GAMECART and press A on it. You will most likely be seeing 2 files ( trim.nds and .nds ) Hover your .nds NOT your .trim.nds , if you continue this guide with the trimmed rom, you will not be able to ap patch your rom due to the software not recognizing it correctly and press A on it. Press A on Copy to gm9/out Your rom will now be in SD:/gm9/out Section II: Patching Find your rom in SD:/gm9/out if you planned to use your sd card at the same time, you can move your rom onto your PC but for the sake of simplicity, I'll keep it there. Extract the contents of the 7z of DS-Scene (since the files aren't in a folder, I'd say you make a new folder for them so you dont mix the files with your other stuff.) Go to the folder you've extracted the contents to and double click DS-Scene Rom Tool.exe You will now be in DS-Scene. DO NOT UPDATE THE AP DATABASE , that will download an outdated version and some games wont be supported anymore. Click File - Open File... and select the rom that you've dumped. Note that the other steps will vary depending if your game has an ap patch available in DS-Scene's database. If it is supported by DS-Scene: There would be a on the AP Patch tab. Move to the Export tab. (Optional) Enable Trim Garbage and then Safe Trim so the rom will be trimmed in size and be AP patched. Make sure Apply AP Patch is enabled. Don't change the Repack Options No repack (.nds|.3ds) by default) Click on Export Rom , select where you want to save your rom and click Save Your rom has been AP patched and optionally trimmed. If it isn't supported by DS-Scene: By clicking on the AP Patch tab, you would see this: Download the xDelta Patcher . Check if there is a patch for your rom there If there is one, continue to step 3. If there isn't one, then either your rom does not need to be AP patched or no patches have been found for your gamr/region. For both of those options, you cannot continue this guide. Open the xdeltaUI.exe , select your .xdelta patch that you got from the odrive, select your rom and select where you want the patched rom to be saved. DO NOT OVERWRITE YOUR ORIGINAL ROM If you get any type of errors, please verify that you are using the right patch for your game and region. If the patching succeeds, your rom has been AP patched.

Buying a Virtual Console is like buying the cart, you can dump the ROM and use it on emulators and rom hacks. Note that the same rules apply on digital games and physical games: - You own ONE license so installing the game in multiple consoles is illegal. - Sharing the rom is illegal For more info, please visit 3ds.eiphax.tech . If you wanted to dump a GBA bios, click here Note that this is for 3DS only This tutorial is valid for: - Gameboy, - Gameboy Color, - NES, - Gameboy Advance, - GameGear, NES VC uses the TNES header which makes them not playable if dumped and trying to fix the header is quite a pain. Luckily, we have a GodMode9 script thanks to Validusername16 that fix the header for you. SNES VC are strangely made so the ROM is altered and cannot be extracted without being vanilla. If you were to extract it correctly, the sound would be destroyed. What you'll need: - A 3ds family system (3ds,2ds,etc.) - CFW (Luma+B9S) if you don't have CFW, go on 3ds.hacks.guide to install it. - Godmode9 (You should already have it due to the CFW guide.) - Access to your SD card - Any valid 3DS Virtual Console game Section I: Dumping Boot while holding the Start button to access Godmode9. Navigate to \u300a[A:] SYSNAND SD\u300b and press A. Hover on \u300atitle\u300b and press R+A. Press A on \u300aSearch for titles\u300b and wait until it finishes searching. At this point, you will see all your installed titles. Find the Virtual Console game that you want to extract the ROM from and press A on it. Press A on \u300aTMD file options...\u300b. Press A on \u300aMount CXI/NDS to drive\u300b. Confirm with A. Now, you will be into the files of the Virtual Console game. THE NEXT STEPS WILL BE DIFFERENT IF YOU ARE DUMPING A GBA VIRTUAL CONSOLE Section II: Extracting a Non-GBA Virtual Console You will see a folder called \u300aromfs\u300b , press A on it. Follow the instructions depending on the system: Gameboy and Gameboy Color Open the folder called: \u300arom\u300b. Press A on the file shown. Press A on \u300aCopy to gm9/out\u300b. Change the file extension to either \u300a.gb\u300b for original Gameboy games and \u300a.gbc\u300b for Gameboy Color games. It is useful to know that DMG is Original Gameboy and CGB is Gameboy Color. NES Open the folder called \u300arom\u300b. Press A on the file shown. Press A on \u300aCopy to gm9/out\u300b. Launch this script Select your rom and select the mirroring. Your rom is now playable in an emulator. GameGear Open the folder called \u300asystem\u300b. Open the folder called \u300aroms\u300b.
